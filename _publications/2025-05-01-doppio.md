Undergraduate Research conducted under Dr. Gerald Kruse (Juniata College), 08/2024 â€“ 05/2025.
* Designed the first FPGA-based architecture for Deterministic Parallel Java (DPJ) by mapping parallel computing
concepts directly onto reconfigurable hardware
* Developed comprehensive hardware modules and implemented deterministic scheduling algorithms for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) integration
* Presented research findings at the Liberal Arts Symposium in April 2025
