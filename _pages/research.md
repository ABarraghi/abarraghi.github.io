## Undergraduate Researcher

### August 2024 - May 2025

### Advised by Gerald Kruse, Juniata College, Huntingdon PA

Throughout the _Computer Science Seminar_ and _Computer Science Research_ sequence of courses, I delved into a research project exploring the implementation of Deterministic Parallel Java (DPJ) on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), aiming to design the first FPGA-based architecture for DPJ by mapping parallel computing concepts directly onto reconfigurable hardware. Involving comprehensive hardware module development, and deterministic scheduling implementation, the research was presented at the Liberal Arts Symposium in April 2025. Following the event I was awarded by the university _Distinction in the Program of Emphasis_ and the _Dale L. Wampler Award in Computer Science_ .
