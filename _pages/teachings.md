In the Spring semester of 2025, I was the one and only Teaching Assistant for the bi-annual course PC209 Electronics.

I assisted Assisted 12 students for theoretical and lab portions for 10 hours every week, and towards the last weeks of the semester lead lectures on BJT transistors, logic gates, and microcontrollers.
