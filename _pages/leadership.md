## Social Innovation Challenge
### March 23 - 24, 2024
### Cannonsburg, PA

I was chosen along with only 5 other students from the entirety of Juniata College to represent the institution in the 2024 "Social Innovation Challenge", hosted by the Entrepreneurship Leadership Council. I lead a team of 4 to present “Nourish the Neighborhood”, an organizational-based approach to mitigate food insecurity across college campuses. Our efforts were highlighted in the [Huntingdon City Newspaper](https://www.huntingdondailynews.com/news/local/juniata-students-compete-in-social-innovation-challenge/article_8b616d75-59f4-5d91-81ff-3cdfb150c36f.html).
