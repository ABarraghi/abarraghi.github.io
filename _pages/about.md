My name is **Arman Barraghi Zadeh**, and I am a first year Master of Science student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), specifically in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/). My graduate studies and research is within the [Computer Architecture, Computer Systems, and Embedded Systems Track](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/research/areas/acses). 

Prior to this, I pursued my undergraduate studies at [Juniata College](https://www.juniata.edu/), where I got a Bachelors of Science in [Computer Science](https://www.juniata.edu/academics/computer-science/index.php). I was awarded _Distinction in the Program of Emphasis_ due to my undergraduate research in implementing and mapping the concepts of Deterministic Parallel Java onto an FPGA. Go Eagles!
